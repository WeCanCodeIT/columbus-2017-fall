Below are some logic problems that may get your brain thinking in the right direction for a Whiteboarding activity. Remember, it is not
all about solving a probelm accurately, first try, but in how you think and talk through a problem. Whiteboarding may be one of the most
difficult aspects of an interview and is one that is argued as to its fairness in the industry, but it exists nonetheless...remember, these companies have reached out to you for an interview most likely as a junior developer that will be trained within the company. Show
them you can think and problem solve and strike up good dialogue during this part of the interview and the interviewer would be smart to 
hire you because you are AWESOME!


## Warm up 

- Return the number of even ints in the given array

## Moderate

- Given an array length 1 or more of ints, return the difference between the largest and smallest values in the array
- Return the sum of the numbers in the array, except ignore sections of numbers starting with a 6 and extending to the next 7 
(every 6 will be followed by at least one 7) Return 0 for no numbers


## Challenging

- Return an array that is "left shifted" by one -- so {6, 2, 5, 3} returns {2, 5, 3, 6}
- Given arrays nums1 and nums2 of the same length, for every element in nums1, consider the corresponding element in nums2 
(at the same index). Return the count of the number of times that the two elements differ by 2 or less, but are not equal.
- Given start and end numbers, return a new array containing the sequence of integers from start up to but not including end,
so start=5 and end=10 yields {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.The end number will be greater or equal to the start number. 
Note that a length-0 array is valid
