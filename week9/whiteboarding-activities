## Warm up 

- Return the number of even ints in the given array

## Moderate

- Given an array length 1 or more of ints, return the difference between the largest and smallest values in the array
- Return the sum of the numbers in the array, except ignore sections of numbers starting with a 6 and extending to the next 7 
(every 6 will be followed by at least one 7) Return 0 for no numbers


## Challenging

- Return an array that is "left shifted" by one -- so {6, 2, 5, 3} returns {2, 5, 3, 6}
- Given arrays nums1 and nums2 of the same length, for every element in nums1, consider the corresponding element in nums2 
(at the same index). Return the count of the number of times that the two elements differ by 2 or less, but are not equal.
- Given start and end numbers, return a new array containing the sequence of integers from start up to but not including end,
so start=5 and end=10 yields {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.The end number will be greater or equal to the start number. 
Note that a length-0 array is valid
