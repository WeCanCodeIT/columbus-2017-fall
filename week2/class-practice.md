## Class Practice Problem

### Bank Account
##### Create a BankAccount class that contains a constructor to hold an account owner's name, initial balance and bank id number. Build methods that would control normal banking behaviors (making a deposit, making a withdrawal, checking your balance...maybe in a toString summary??) Create a driver class that initializes a bank account object and work with it, testing all methods that you built.
