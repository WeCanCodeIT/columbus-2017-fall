1. Create a map for a restaurant's menu with the menu items and prices (use `double`) for the items as entries.

    |menu item|price|
    |---------|----:|
    |Spaghetti|$8.97|
    |Lasagna|$10.98|
    |Pizza|$15.50|
    |Caesar Salad|$7.00|
    |Kale Salad|$7.00|

    Stretch: Use `BigDecimal` and its `String` constructor rather than a double for prices.
  
1. Explore the commonly used map methods by solving the following problems. Display results to the console via `System.out`.

    - [ ] A customer insists that the bill is incorrect and that the menu listed the price of spaghetti at $7.97. Print the menu price of the spaghetti.
