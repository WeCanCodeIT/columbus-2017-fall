## Industry Language Week 4

#### What is it we are saying? What are these words, terms, acronyms??? The programming world has their own lingo and we need to learn how to speak. Not only so you know what we are saying, but so you are industry ready when talking with potential employers.

## Key Terms
- **Inheritance**: The process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields-variables) of another
- **Child, Derived, Subclass**: The class that inherits these properties
- **Superclass, Base, Parent**: The class whose properties are inherited
- **Is-A Relationship**: The way we think of/define inheritance in Java
- **instanceof**: Tests the is-a relationship with a boolean result
- **extends**: Creates a subclass of a superclass
- **super**: similar to the this keyword it serves 2 main functions
            - invokes the superclass constructor from the subclass
            - used to differentiate methods of superclass from methods of the subclass if they have the same names
- **Abstract**: may or may not have an abstract method...has to be abstract if there is a method with no implementation. You cannot create an instance of an abstract class..if you inherit an abstract class you must code the abstract methods (called **implementation**)
- **Polymorphism**: Having many forms
- **Encapsulation**: The process of hiding information about an object from other objects
- **Method Override**: Method inherited by a child class that has been altered
- **Kata**: A term said to be coined by programmer David Thomas, that relates to coding in reference to a pattern of 
            movements in Japanese martial arts. Students of a kata study it was a form, not as a conclusion.
            It is not the conclusion that matters but the steps that lead to the conclusion.
