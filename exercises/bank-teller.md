# Bank Teller

## Objective

Design a `BankAccount` class that will perform capabilities of a single Bank Account, and a `BankingApp` (with a `main` method) to simulate a Bank Teller being able to access accounts and perform deposits and withdrawals for people in those accounts.

### Tasks

Inside of `BankAccout` Class program the following:
- 3 instance variables to handle name, balance and a pin
- note the pin will be a unique identifier
- create the `Constructor` to read in a BankAccount object
- create the following methods: `getName(), getBalance(), deposit(double amount), withdrawal(double amount)`


Inside of the `BankingApp` Class program the following:
- Create the proper Map to hold the collection of accounts
- Create 3 BankAccounts
- Add these accounts to the collection
- Welcome the user and display the accounts (ok so you wouldn't display people's bank accounts in real life but...)
- Have a menu of options for the teller to access an account, do a deposit, withdrawal or exit
