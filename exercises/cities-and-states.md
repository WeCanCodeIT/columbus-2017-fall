# Cities and States Pair Programming Activity

## Objectives
- Students will use **Object Relational Mapping (ORM)** to connect entities together 
- Students will become familiar with the tools of the CRUD Repository
- Students will create data to test by @Override of the run method of CommandLineRunner
- Students will complete this activity in a pair-programming setting where one is always "driving" and one is "directing"

Your job is to create a `State` with a `name` property and `City` with `state` and `name` properties. A `State` can contain multiple `City` entities. 

In pairs, build this program out, use the command line runner to populate your cities and states. Build out a front end with Thymeleaf templates to show a list of States. When you click on each State, you will be able to see the cities belonging to that particular state.
