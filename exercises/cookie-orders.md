### Girl Scout Cookie Order

We have all been there, the irresistible face of the cute kid selling tasty cookies. They're everywhere...
at the store, knocking on the door, in the parking lot...
Create an ArrayList project that keeps track of the variety of cookie you ordered and the quantity. You will also
keep track of your total number of boxes purchased.

## The `CookieOrder` Class
- Wite this class to keep track of 2 pieces of instance data: `variety` of cookie and `numBoxes` purchased
- Create the constructor to handle this data and 2 accessor methods

## The `MasterOrder` Class will maintain a list of cookies being purchased
- Declare your ArrayList and name it `orders`
- Create a construcor
- `public void addOrder(CookieOrder theOrder)`
