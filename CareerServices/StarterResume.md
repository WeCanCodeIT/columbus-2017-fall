## Updating Your Starter Resume
In this session, students should all bring a copy of their current resume to class. We will be focusing on making some initial updates to the resume, so it’s ready for general purpose use. This will also serve as a guide for the following session on developing a strong LinkedIn profile.

### Part 1
- [ ] Remove Objective Field and replace with a summary/profile
- [ ] Remove any outdated software or terminology
- [ ] Include links to your online presence (personal website/blog/portfolio, LinkedIn profile)
  - [ ] Social Networks I would consider not linking (facebook, IG, twitter depending on how you use it)
- [ ] Remove your address and just include city and state
- [ ] Apply [action verbs](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/powerful-resume-action-verbs-0317) to your resume
- [ ] Check your fonts! Fonts should not be playful or unprofessional
- [ ] Remove "references available upon request"
- [ ] Length Requirement: Unless you are a seasoned professional already in tech, your resume should be 1 page (Remove the fluff)

### Part 2
- [ ] Brainstorm & write out a list of your most desirable, related qualifications (should form the cornerstone of your resume) 
  - [ ] You can get ideas from skills listed on [Past Resumes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzvIL8y5U8RDbklXamdMVE1iams?usp=sharing), job listings, other developers’ LinkedIn Profiles
- [ ] Choose chronological, functional, or combination for your resume format depending on your past experience([See article](https://www.thebalance.com/resume-types-chronological-functional-combination-2063235))
- [ ] [Quantify achievements](https://resumegenius.com/how-to-write-a-resume/accomplishments-on-resume-quantify-achievements) for any relevant work history
