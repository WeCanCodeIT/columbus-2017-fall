## LinkedIn Profile Checklist
LinkedIn is one of the most popular online social platforms and is the #1 choice when it comes to using a social platform to build your professional brand and make professional connections for your career. There are several main features of LinkedIn, including:
- News Feed
- Profile
- Network
- Jobs
- Interests & Learning (Lynda)
- Pending Invivations

We will be using LinkedIn as a tool for inbound marketing yourself and creating credibility as your transition to a new tech career. For the purpose of this LinkedIn lesson, we will be focused on creating a LinkedIn Profile. You can read more about what LinkedIn offers in this [article](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-linkedin-3486382).

### Step 1: Create a Free LinkedIn Account
- [ ] Navigate in Google Chrome to [LinkedIn.com](http://www.linkedin.com)
- [ ] Complete the form and click "Join Now"

### Step 2: Create a Headline for Your Profile
By default, your LinkedIn profile Headline is your current job title and employer, but your headline should say more than that because having the right keywords in your headline can dramatically improve your SEO. Here's what your headline should include:
- [ ] Offer information on your experiences and career
- [ ] Apply keywords
- [ ] Specify a job title that can be identified with

Before Example: “Vice President Sales at ABC Corporation” (your current position)
After Example: “VP Sales. Revenue Growth in Cloud-Enabled Technology Solutions. Product Development & Sales Operations Leadership”  (your current position with more keywords added to more fully explain it)

- [Indeed JobTrends for Keyword Search](https://www.indeed.com/jobtrends)
- Use other developers at your Bucket List companies as examples. What keywords are they using? What do their headlines say?
(Remeber, not all LinkedIn profiles of other developers are necessarily good examples)

### Step 3: Present a Professional Profile Photo
- Headshots will be taken NEXT Friday during class
- Come prepared, dress for the job you want

### Step 4: Personalize your LinkedIn Profile URL
- [ ] Use your name either together, such as laurenmholloway or separated by hyphens like lauren-holloway
- [ ] Located under your profile (Edit/Update)

### Step 5: Offer your value statement through the Summary section
- [ ] Your summary section is another key location for keywords to improve your SEO on LinkedIn. Unlike your resume, your LinkedIn summary is allowed to take a more conversational tone and include more of your personality.

### Step 6: Add Your Work Experience
- [ ] Make your work experience keyword-rich
- [ ] Start by using your resume as a guide

### Step 7: Add Skills
- [ ] Add skills that are relevant to your career as a developer
- [ ] Use other developers at your Bucket List companies as examples
