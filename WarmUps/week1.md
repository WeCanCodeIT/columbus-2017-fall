## Week 1

### Tues Sept 26

In Eclipse access your week-1 project folder and create a class called **Columbus Facts**
  - Use proper naming conventions on **Columbus Facts** as the name of your class
  - Code the proper commands to print the following in your console
 
 ```bash
    Columbus is ranked 8th in U.S. cities for tech job growth
    Ranked first in Scaling startups
    Ranked top city for mid-career professionals 
   ```
  

### Wed Sept 27

In Eclipse access **ColumbusFacts** from yesterday
  - Add the line of output below, using concatenation to make the numbers numerical and not characters in the String
  
  `4280 new jobs were announced by over 80 companies in 2016`
  
  - Refactor your code to reference 2016 as a variable in the output statement
  - Your console should produce what is below
 
 ```bash
    Columbus is ranked 8th in U.S. cities for tech job growth
    Ranked first in Scaling startups
    Ranked top city for mid-career professionals 
    4280 new jobs were announced by over 80 companies in 2016
   ```

### Thurs Sept 28

What is wrong with this code? Re-write using proper Java convention?

 ```bash
   
public class Testapplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
  
   int testnumberone = 1;
   int testnumbertwo = 2;
  
   int sum = testnumberone + testnumbertwo; 
	
		System.out.println("The sum of the two numbers is 3");
		
	}

}
   ```


### Fri Sept 29

In Eclipse access **ColumbusFacts** 
  - Ask the user to enter a city
  - If Columbus is entered then display the facts we have produced
  - Any other city that is entered say 
   `Why do you want to know about any city other than Columbus?`
   
  - Your console should produce what is below
 
 ```bash
    Enter a city for information: Columbus

    Columbus is ranked 8th in U.S. cities for tech job growth
    Ranked first in Scaling startups
    Ranked top city for mid-career professionals 
    4280 new jobs were announced by over 80 companies in 2016
  ```
