## Accessing the Local Server
- Access to the local server is done when you run your spring application and type localhost:8080/...

### Go to the Google Website
- When you type www.google.com a web browser opens a connection to default port 80
- This connects to the google server
- A request is sent to the web page
- Google server responds with a website calling images/css/javascript/JQuery...etc 
- You see a beautiful web page

### localhost:8080
- This provides a similar concept
- localhost resolves to the machine you are running
- **Apache Tomcat**: a server that listens on a port and runs java programs that generate content to send to your browser
  - running locally, (running our app in Eclipse) listening for connections on port 8080
